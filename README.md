# Hotel Reservation website

This project is based off the LinkedIn Learning course by Frank P Moley III, "Learning Spring with Spring Boot"

Implemented MVC architecture with Spring Boot, utilizing models for data management, controllers for handling user requests, 
and Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic views, while integrating Spring Data JPA for database interactions enabling CRUD operations for room and reservation data, 
and developing RESTful web services to expose APIs for managing hotel reservations and room data.
